## Design Patterns

### What are Design Patterns?

In software development, **design patterns** are reusable solutions to common problems. They provide a way to create flexible and maintainable software by promoting best practices in design and architecture.

### Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns offer several benefits:

- **Reusability:** Solve common problems in a reusable way.
- **Scalability:** Provide a structured approach to software design.
- **Maintainability:** Capture best practices for future reference.
- **Collaboration:** Establish a common vocabulary for discussing solutions.

## Included Design Patterns

Briefly mention any design patterns that are prominently used in your project. For example:

- **[Singleton Pattern](../../tree/Singleton_Pattern):** Used to ensure a class has only one instance.
- **[Prototype Pattern](../../tree/Prototype_Pattern):** Used for object creation by cloning an existing object.
- **[Builder Pattern](../../tree/Builder_Pattern):** Facilitates the construction of complex objects step by step. Useful when you need to create an object with many optional components.
- **[Decorator Pattern](../../tree/Decorator_Pattern):** Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- **[Observer Pattern](../../tree/Observer_Pattern):** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **[Facade Pattern](../../tree/Facade_Pattern):** Simplifies the interaction with a complex subsystem by providing a unified interface. It acts as a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use for clients.
